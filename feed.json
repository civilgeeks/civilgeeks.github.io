Building Information Modelling use the techniques of mathematical modelling on different aspects of building design in order to maximize the feasibility of the process and least usage of resources. In the original article Mr. Ruffle talks about the presence of large solution set for building design problems. He then suggests the usage of mathematical modelling to restrict the solution space by different constraints.</p>\n<p>BIM usually deals with 6-7 parameters of a project. These parameters are also called dimensions of the model. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Length</li>\n<li>Width Depth</li>\n<li>Time</li>\n<li>Cost</li>\n<li>Environmental Factors &amp; Sustainability</li>\n<li>Building Management</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>BIM Softwares:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revit</li>\n<li>XBIM Toolkit</li>\n<li>Free CAD</li>\n</ul>",
